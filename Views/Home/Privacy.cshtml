<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>Welcome, Vault Dweller! Here at Vault-Tec, your privacy is as sacred as a fully stocked Nuka-Cola stash. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal data – and rest assured, we won’t use it to fund any secret experiments (unless it’s for your benefit, of course).</p>

<h2>1. What Rad Data Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>Just like scavenging for supplies in the wasteland, we gather a little bit of information to keep your vault running smoothly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your name, email, and other details you voluntarily provide (we promise not to sell your info to raiders).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information like your IP address, browser type, and which rad zones (pages) you visit on our website.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Gizmos:</strong> Yes, we use cookies – not the edible kind, but the digital kind – to enhance your experience and monitor our wasteland (website) activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Do We Use Your Precious Data?</h2>
<p>Your information helps us maintain a state-of-the-art vault:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To operate, maintain, and upgrade our vault (website) systems.</li>
    <li>To personalize your experience, so you feel like a true vault dweller.</li>
    <li>To analyze usage trends and make our services as smooth as a well-oiled Pip-Boy.</li>
    <li>To send you updates and possibly some Vault-Tec-approved offers (we promise no radroach-infested spam).</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Sharing? Only With Trusted Vault Dwellers</h2>
<p>We don’t sell or trade your data to any shady outposts. However, we may share your info with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Loyal partners who help keep the vault (our website) running, under strict confidentiality (and a Vault-Tec non-disclosure oath).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Vault-Enforcers:</strong> If the Overseer (or law) demands it, we’ll comply to protect our vault, our data, and your well-being.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cookies and Other Gizmos</h2>
<p>We use digital cookies to track your movements in our vault. You can disable cookies in your browser, but beware – some parts of our vault might not work as intended. And no, you can’t eat these cookies!</p>

<h2>5. Data Security: Keeping the Wasteland at Bay</h2>
<p>Our security measures are tougher than a super mutant’s hide. We use state-of-the-art (and rad-approved) safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access. However, remember that even in a post-apocalyptic world, no system is 100% secure against every mutated threat.</p>

<h2>6. How Long Do We Keep Your Data?</h2>
<p>Your personal information is stored only as long as it’s needed – think of it like your favorite bottle of Nuka-Cola; we keep it fresh until it’s time to upgrade.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights in the Wasteland</h2>
<p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time. If you want to exercise these rights, send us a message via our secure Pip-Boy communicator (or, you know, email us at <a href="mailto:support@vaulttec.com">support@vaulttec.com</a>).</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>The wasteland is always changing, and so might our Privacy Policy. When we make updates, the revised date will be shown at the bottom of this page. Keep checking back to stay informed!</p>

<h2>9. Contact Our Overseers</h2>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or simply want to chat about the best Nuka-Cola flavor, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@vaulttec.com">support@vaulttec.com</a>.</p>
